        "Description": "Constitutional carry empowers law-abiding gun owners to protect themselves and others from criminals. Even though states disallow felons and other criminals from possessing firearms, criminals obviously aren’t keen on following the law. Constitutional carry means criminals have no idea who in their vicinity might be carrying a concealed gun, which increases the danger for the criminal. What might have been a simple robbery at an ATM after dark in a no-issue state, could turn fatal for the robber in a constitutional carry state.",
